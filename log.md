# 100 Days Of Code (Newbie version) - Log
Given my limited coding skills and computer science knowledge, I decide to take this challenge slowly in a vanilla fashion. The goal is to working on Coding Skills / Computer Science at least 0.5 hr every day in order to achieve steady progress.

### Day 1: 2017-06-04 (Sunday)
<!--- ##### (delete me or comment me out)--->

**Today's Progress**: Look for solution to download my p5.js canvas animation as .gif, Change parameters in Typing Monkey Example from Kadenze's Nature of Code

**Thoughts:** CCapture.js is a possible solution. It seems that I can download that by adding another .js library, but it will take me at least 1 - 2 weeks before I can implement it in my p5.js sketch. For genetic algorithm, I have to take a closer look at
1. fitness function
2. probability
3. reproduction mechanism
4. crossover mechanism
5. mutation mechanism

Ha, it looks like the BCB material in my UG years.

### Day 2: 2017-06-05 (Monday)
<!--- ##### (delete me or comment me out) --->

**Today's Progress**: Set up an a/c and read about the Beatles, Figure out how to clone with git command line and Flip through the code of example CCapture.js

**Thoughts**: Putting thoughts into action seems daunting at first, and it goes smoothly after the first step. Account set, ready to throw the party~ Thanks to the outdoor office chore, I have an extra 0.5 hr to read about the Beatles. This adds to 1 hr reading including the 0.5 hr session on commute. I still don't quite understand the CCapture.js example code, and need to work harder on that.

### Day 3: 2017-06-06 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Practise Markdown, Study Typing Monkey example from Nature of Code and Write my first html & javaScript snippet in my life

**Thoughts**

*Markdown*

I didn't know that a numbered list can be created _without_ specifying the bullet number!

`1.

*Surfing internet*

I would like to learn more about the Beatle's music. There are a lot of great resources on the Beatles. Haha I browse some of them at office.

*HTML Snippet*

I study the .js files in the example and follow the line, then a question bumps up: What is the output of `function DNA(num)`? A few random character or just a few? In order to verify that, I try the line in different javaScript tester, and putting all the pieces together gives me an html file that gives random character, just one character.

### Day 4: 2017-06-07 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress** Fix Git commit problem

**Thoughts**

*Git*

I spent a morning trying to figure out why I can't commit from my Git Desktop OMG. I never expected that Git, a versioning tool, would be a problem to be included in my 100-day challenge, but it _is_ a problem. There is a little problem with email privacy setting, and it is all solved in a morning, thanks to Stack Overflow. I get a pretty log too~
