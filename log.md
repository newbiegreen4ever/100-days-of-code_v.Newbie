# 100 Days Of Code (Newbie version) - Log
Given my limited coding skills and computer science knowledge, I decide to take this challenge slowly in a vanilla fashion. The goal is to working on Coding Skills / Computer Science at least 0.5 hr every day in order to achieve steady progress.

**Today's Progress**: Look for solution to download my p5.js canvas animation as .gif, Change parameters in Typing Monkey Example from Kadenze's Nature of Code

**Thoughts:** CCapture.js is a possible solution. It seems that I can download that by adding another .js library, but it will take me at least 1 - 2 weeks before I can implement it in my p5.js sketch. For genetic algorithm, I have to take a closer look at 
1. fitness function
2. probability
3. reproduction mechanism
4. crossover mechanism
5. mutation mechanism

Ha, it looks like the BCB material in my UG years.

**Today's Progress**: Set up an a/c and read about the Beatles, Figure out how to clone with git command line and Flip through the code of example CCapture.js

**Thoughts**: Putting thoughts into action seems daunting at first, and it goes smoothly after the first step. Account set, ready to throw the party~ Thanks to the outdoor office chore, I have an extra 0.5 hr to read about the Beatles. This adds to 1 hr reading including the 0.5 hr session on commute. I still don't quite understand the CCapture.js example code, and need to work harder on that.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
