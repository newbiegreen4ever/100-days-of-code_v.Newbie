# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will devote at least 0.5 hour to Code / Learn about Computer Science every day for the next 100 days.*
### > (1.01)^100 = 2.70 (corr. to 3 sig. fig.)

#### Start Date
2017-06-04 (Sunday)

## Additional Rules
1. I will push code to GitHub every day so that I can record my progress, if any
2. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that I can record my progress.
3. I will try to type something down, regardless of code / reflection

## Ideas to make this challenge more effective
1. To increase the chances of success, it's a requirement that you add a link to each of the day posts in the [log](log.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post
2. If you get upset or stuck, read this article: [Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd)
3. If you don't know why there is such an emphasis on working on the projects vs doing tutorials or online courses, read this: [How to Get a Developer Job in Less Than a Year](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645)
4. If you can't push your code to GitHub for some reason (e.g. if you're only starting to code and doing interactive exercises), provide a link to a tweet. You can think of something else as long as your challenge stays public - and you get the benefit of being committed to it and accountable for your progress.
5. Another good bonus of forking this repo -> if you haven't worked with Markdown before, it's a good way to practice.
